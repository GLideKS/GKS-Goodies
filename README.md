# GKS Goodies - Extras and balancing for gamemodes

Before named GKS Racing, now rebranded to GKS Goodies! it's the main file that GKS Racing Server and GKS RS Revolution Server was using for Sonic Robo Blast 2, now serves for many purposes!

The point of this Sonic Robo Blast 2 addon is to overall make the gamemodes interesting, with some mechanics for balancing, music change on overtime/lowtime, and cosmetic stuff like a custom hud as a future feature.

## What does it contain?

- **A modified version of [Hurry up](https://mb.srb2.org/addons/hurry-up-a-level-exit-timer.1442/)** addon for race gametype. When the countdown shows up, makes an earthquake and changes the music.
- **Character voices** for all vanilla characters and specific custom characters. *external support might come eventually*
- ~**Racing tips** according to GKS Server's addons that helps new players to understand the advantages in the server.~ *not available at the moment.*
- **Damage prevention on race countdown.** If you don't like this feature, you can disable it with gdrace_countdowndamage *(command not available yet)*
- **Race start music** like Super SRB2 Kart Z (srb2 kart before srb2 kart). A racing start music will be played on each map load.
- **Get a damage aura boost when using speed shoes** and take down your rivals!
- **Team color variants.** Isn't that boring that your team carries a single color? well, not anymore! with this addon you can see your mates with red/blue variants.
- **Overtime and low time music.** on time limit or point limit gamemodes, the music will change according to the situation such as match point, 30 seconds left or overtime.
