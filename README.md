# GKS Racing Server Main file

GKS Racing it's the main file that GKS Racing server uses for Sonic Robo Blast 2, this server is not available anymore *(as far as I know, the server died around October 2024)*.

The point of this Sonic Robo Blast 2 addon is to overall make the Race/Competition gamemode interesting, with some mechanics mainly for balancing. and cosmetic stuff like a custom hud as a future feature.

## What does it contain?

- **A modified version of [Hurry up](https://mb.srb2.org/addons/hurry-up-a-level-exit-timer.1442/)** addon for race gametype. When the countdown shows up, makes an earthquake and changes the music.
- **Character voices** for all vanilla characters and specific custom characters. *external support might come eventually*
- **Racing tips** according to GKS Server's addons that helps new players to understand the advantages in the server. *external support might come eventually*
- **Race start music** like Super SRB2 Kart Z (srb2 kart before srb2 kart). A racing start music will be played on each map load. *external support might come eventually*
- **Intermission background changed**. just a replacement specifically for the server. at this point is planned to be removed.
- **Get a damage aura boost when using speed shoes** and take down your rivals!
